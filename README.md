# Movie-Recommedation-App
A movie recommendation system attempts to anticipate preferences based on the user's selections. The Web-App created for this project using Python suggests movies based on the user's liked movies.

<h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
<b> One significant category of machine learning algorithms that provides consumers with "appropriate" choices is the recommender system. All three sites—YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix—have systems that suggest videos or products to you based on your past behavior (called content-based filtering) or on the behaviors and preferences of other users who have your interests (Collaborative Filtering).

Recommendation Systems work based on the similarity between either the content or the users who access the content.There are several ways to measure the similarity between two items. The recommendation systems use this similarity matrix to recommend the next most similar product to the user.

In this project, we will build a machine learning model that would recommend movies based on a movie the user likes. This Machine Learning model would be based on Cosine Similarity.</b>
